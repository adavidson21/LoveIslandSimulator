# Love Island Simulator

## Project Overview
The Love Island Simulator is a reality game show-inspired application where players simulate islanders competing in challenges, adopting dynamic roles, and executing unique behaviors. The project integrates design patterns to deliver a modular and scalable gameplay experience.

## Features
1. **Dynamic Challenges**:
   - Challenges (e.g., Trivia, Physical, Social) are executed using the **Command Pattern** for flexibility and modularity.
   - Players select challenges, simulate outcomes, and view updated scores.

2. **Islander Behaviors**:
   - Islander strategies, such as Aggressive, Balanced, and Passive, are set at the start of the game using the **Strategy Pattern**.

3. **Roles and Enhancements**:
   - Using the **Decorator Pattern**, roles like Flirt, Outsider, or Leader are dynamically assigned during gameplay, enhancing islander actions in challenges.

4. **Score Management**:
   - The **Singleton Pattern** ensures consistent score tracking across the game.

5. **User Flow**:
   - The flow has been refined for clarity and gameplay:  
     1. Select a behavior strategy for each islander.  
     2. Choose a challenge.  
     3. Assign roles to islanders dynamically.  
     4. Simulate the challenge.  
     5. Display actions taken and update the scoreboard.
